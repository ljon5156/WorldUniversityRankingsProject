# Objective

Universities throughout the world are judged every year based on a variety of different criteria. This project looks at three different Ranking systems and sees how rankings and trends differ between them. The goal is to determine which universities are the best and which countries generally have the best institutions. 

# Data

Each ranking system provided their own data and additional data sources were supplemented for further analysis. 
- cwurData
- timesData
- shanghaiData
- education_expenditure
- educational_attainment
- school_and_country_table
- world-countries.json (found from Kaggle at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ktochylin/world-countries)

# Analysis Results

The link below shows the final Tableau storyboard that summarizes the results from the project. Certain graphs and steps were omitted due to insignificant results or other difficulties but these steps can still be found in the Python scripts.
