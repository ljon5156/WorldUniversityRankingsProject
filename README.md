# WorldUniversityRankingsProject

This project contains Excel CSV Files, Python code, and a Tableau Storybook based on World University data from Kaggle.

# Objective

Universities throughout the world are judged every year based on a variety of different criteria. This project looks at three different Ranking systems and sees how rankings and trends differ between them. The goal is to determine which universities are the best and which countries generally have the best institutions. 

# Data

Each ranking system provided their own data and additional data sources were supplemented for further analysis.
